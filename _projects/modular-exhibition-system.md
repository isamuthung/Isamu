## Project Overview

The National Design Museum needed a flexible exhibition system for their traveling shows that would minimize environmental impact while maintaining a high standard of presentation. The challenge was to create a system that could adapt to various spaces, be easily installed by non-specialists, and significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with temporary exhibitions.

## Design Challenge

Traditional exhibition systems face several critical issues:

1. **Environmental impact**: Conventional temporary exhibits often result in substantial waste, with custom-built displays typically discarded after a single use
2. **Installation complexity**: Many systems require specialized teams for assembly, increasing costs and logistical challenges
3. **Adaptability limitations**: Most modular systems offer limited flexibility for different types of content and spatial contexts
4. **Transportation inefficiency**: Bulky components lead to higher shipping costs and carbon emissions

## Solution

The designed solution is a comprehensive modular system with the following key features:

### Component Design

The core of the system consists of lightweight, interlocking aluminum components that can be configured in numerous ways without requiring specialized tools. Key elements include:

- **Structural frames** with integrated cable management
- **Display panels** in various materials (fabric, acrylic, wood veneer)
- **Connector nodes** allowing for multiple configuration angles
- **Integrated lighting system** with adjustable LED modules
- **Media mounts** for screens and interactive elements

### Sustainable Approach

Sustainability was central to all design decisions:

- **Materials selection**: Aluminum was chosen for its durability, recyclability, and lightweight properties
- **Design for disassembly**: All components can be easily separated for recycling at end of life
- **Compact shipping**: The entire system nests efficiently, reducing shipping volume by approximately 60% compared to conventional systems
- **Durability focus**: Components are designed for a minimum of 50 reuse cycles, with easy replacement of wear items

### Installation Process

The system's design dramatically simplifies the installation process:

1. Basic configurations can be assembled by a team of two people
2. Color-coded components and integrated alignment guides minimize errors
3. No specialized tools required beyond a simple hex key (provided with the system)
4. Typical installation time is reduced by approximately 40% compared to conventional systems

## Development Process

The system was developed through an iterative process over eight months:

1. **Research phase**: Studied existing systems and interviewed exhibition designers about pain points
2. **Concept development**: Created multiple potential approaches focusing on connection mechanisms
3. **Prototyping**: Built functional prototypes of key components to validate assembly methods
4. **Testing**: Conducted durability testing and installation simulations with museum staff
5. **Refinement**: Optimized designs based on testing feedback
6. **Production**: Developed final manufacturing specifications and quality control guidelines

## Results

The system has successfully supported five exhibitions across three countries since its launch:

- **Installation time** reduced by an average of 43%
- **Shipping costs** decreased by 37%
- **Carbon footprint** of exhibitions reduced by approximately 60%
- **Flexibility** demonstrated through adaptation to venues ranging from 200 to 1,100 square meters

The modular nature of the system has allowed the museum to continuously expand its capabilities, with new components developed to meet emerging needs while maintaining compatibility with the existing system.

## Recognition

The project has received several industry accolades:

- Sustainable Design Award, International Exhibition Association
- Innovation in Museums Award, Cultural Heritage Foundation
- Honorable Mention, Industrial Design Excellence Awards
